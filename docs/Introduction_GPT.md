## **Introduction**

Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI that has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP). Introduced in 2019, GPT-2 demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant text, performing a wide array of language tasks without task-specific training data. This article provides a comprehensive understanding of GPT-2, delving into its architecture, training methodology, capabilities, limitations, and the underlying principles that contribute to its performance.

## **Background: Language Models and Transformers**

Before exploring GPT-2, it's essential to understand the evolution of language models and the significance of the Transformer architecture.

- **Language Models (LMs)**: Statistical models that assign probabilities to sequences of words. They are foundational in tasks like speech recognition, machine translation, and text generation.

- **Traditional LMs**: Utilized methods like n-grams and Hidden Markov Models, which had limitations in capturing long-range dependencies due to fixed context windows.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Introduced to handle sequential data, but suffered from issues like vanishing gradients, making it challenging to capture long-term dependencies.

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)**: Developed to mitigate RNN limitations, but still faced computational inefficiencies for long sequences.

- **Transformers**: Introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017, the Transformer architecture revolutionized NLP by relying entirely on self-attention mechanisms, allowing for parallelization and better handling of long-range dependencies.

---

## **Overview of GPT-2**

GPT-2 is built upon the Transformer decoder architecture and is part of a family of models that utilize unsupervised pre-training followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks.

- **Unsupervised Pre-training**: The model is trained on a vast corpus of unlabelled text data to predict the next word in a sequence, learning grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities.

- **Generative Capabilities**: GPT-2 can generate human-like text by extending a given prompt, maintaining coherence over long passages.

- **Zero-Shot Learning**: The model demonstrates the ability to perform tasks it wasn't explicitly trained on, such as translation and summarization, by leveraging its understanding of language patterns.

---

## **Architecture of GPT-2**

GPT-2's architecture is a stack of Transformer decoder layers. Below, we explore the critical components of this architecture.

### **4.1 Transformer Decoder**

The Transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder. GPT-2 utilizes only the decoder part, designed for autoregressive tasks where the model predicts the next token based on previous tokens.

**Key Components of the Transformer Decoder:**

- **Self-Attention Layers**: Allow the model to focus on different positions in the input sequence to capture dependencies.

- **Masked Self-Attention**: Ensures that predictions for a position can only depend on the known outputs at positions before it, preserving the autoregressive property.

- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Apply non-linear transformations to capture complex patterns.

- **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**: Facilitate training deep networks by stabilizing gradients and improving convergence.

### **4.2 Self-Attention Mechanism**

Self-attention computes the representation of a word in a sequence by attending to all other words in the sequence.

**Calculations Involved:**

- **Queries (Q)**, **Keys (K)**, and **Values (V)**: For each position, linear transformations generate Q, K, and V vectors.

- **Attention Scores**: Computed as the dot product of Q and K, scaled by the square root of the dimension, and passed through a softmax function to obtain weights.

- **Context Vectors**: Weighted sum of the V vectors using the attention weights.

**Formula:**

\[
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\]

Where \( d_k \) is the dimension of the key vectors.

### **4.3 Multi-Head Attention**

Multi-head attention allows the model to focus on different positions and represent different types of relationships.

- **Parallel Attention Heads**: Multiple attention mechanisms run in parallel, each with its own Q, K, V transformations.

- **Concatenation and Linear Transformation**: The outputs from each head are concatenated and passed through a linear layer to combine the information.

**Benefits:**

- **Capturing Diverse Patterns**: Each head can learn different aspects of the input, such as syntax and semantics.

- **Improved Representational Capacity**: Enhances the model's ability to capture complex relationships.

### **4.4 Position-Wise Feed-Forward Networks**

Applied to each position separately and identically, these networks introduce non-linearity after the attention layers.

**Structure:**

- **Two Linear Layers**: With a non-linear activation (typically GELU) in between.

**Formula:**

\[
\text{FFN}(x) = \text{max}(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
\]

### **4.5 Positional Embeddings**

Since the Transformer architecture doesn't inherently consider the order of tokens, positional embeddings are added to the input embeddings to provide sequence order information.

**Types of Positional Embeddings:**

- **Learned Positional Embeddings**: Parameters learned during training, specific to each position.

- **Sinusoidal Positional Embeddings**: Deterministic functions based on sine and cosine, allowing the model to generalize to sequences longer than seen during training.

GPT-2 uses learned positional embeddings.

### **4.6 Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**

- **Layer Normalization**: Normalizes the inputs across the features, stabilizing the learning process.

- **Residual Connections**: Add the input of a layer to its output, helping gradients flow backward and enabling deeper networks.

### **5.2 Detailed Parameter Counts**

**Parameters are calculated based on:**

- **Embedding Layers**:

  - Positional Embeddings: Sequence Length × Hidden Size

- **Transformer Blocks**:
  - **Attention Layers**:
    - Q, K, V Linear Layers: Hidden Size × (Hidden Size per Head × Number of Heads) × 3
    - Output Linear Layer: (Hidden Size per Head × Number of Heads) × Hidden Size
  - **Feed-Forward Networks**:
    - First Linear Layer: Hidden Size × Intermediate Size
    - Second Linear Layer: Intermediate Size × Hidden Size

- **Layer Normalization**:
  - Parameters for scaling and shifting: 2 × Hidden Size per Layer

**Example Calculation for GPT-2 Small (117M):**

- **Word Embeddings**: 50,257 (vocabulary size) × 768 = ~38.6M
- **Positional Embeddings**: 1,024 (max positions) × 768 = ~0.8M
- **Transformer Layers**: Each layer has approximately 7.7M parameters, totaling ~92M for 12 layers.
